# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment4
This is a program demonstrating the use of the containers map and unordered map. There is no input and only gives an output. The documentation explains the overall function, but for an overview of the program:

The program has two main classes, StoredItem and StorageManager.

Storage manager takes the reference of StoredItem via pointer.

The data is input into the reference container with the STL built ins.

Each pointer will "find" the corresponding point of data (i.e. point to the address in the container, but find it's contents, NOT the address itself)
